***User Story***

As a user, I will be able to click on a button that says start at under the instructions I can read about how to play the game Simon.  I will be able to see the colors of the tiles change in a timed order and try to recreate that order in a way that adds one colored block at a time each round to make the game progressivly harder.  I will be see when I make a mistake because the game will tell me after I incorrectly push one of the tiles out of order.  I will see what my streak is at the bottom of the game board and I will be able to try to beat my score every time.
